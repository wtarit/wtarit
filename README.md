# 👋 Hi there, I'm Tarit Witworrasakul!

I’m a third-year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) with a passion for solving problems and building solutions to make life easier through programming. My journey began with Arduino robot programming, which sparked my interest in creating innovative systems. Over time, I expanded my skill set to include web development, mobile apps, and embedded systems.

I believe in continuous learning and enjoy exploring new tools and technologies. Whether it's crafting efficient algorithms or designing user-friendly applications, I'm always up for a challenge.

## 💻 Technologies & Tools
Here are some of the languages, libraries, and tools I currently use:
- **Languages**: Python, Dart, TypeScript, C, C++  
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: NextJS, OpenCV, Huggingface, Pandas, NumPy, FastAPI, Streamlit, Gradio, Flutter, Arduino   
- **Tools**: Git, Linux, Docker, Docker Compose, Postman, Cloudflare, Firebase, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Supabase, Vercel, ChromaDB, PostgreSQL
